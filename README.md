Methodology/Procedure-
Our project has divided into following  steps:
Experimenting :In this step, we were discussing about the necessary equipments and materials. We were studying about the similar projects, gathering the information of programming language to be used. 

Design :In this phase, we were designing the layout of the appliances .The necessary features to be included. We were designing the power strip to connect the home appliances that can be controlled via GPIO pins and relay module.

Code implementation: We learned python to a certain extent and we have successfully implemented the code.
Bugs and testing :We faced a lot of problems pairing the smartphone to the raspberry we have overcomed this problem by updating our drivers.
Final result: Our project was a  success and it promisingly delivered what we expected.
